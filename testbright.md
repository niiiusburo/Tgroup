# TestSprite Plan: NK2 Trợ lý bác sĩ selector restore 2026-07-03

Feature/edit name: Employee role inference classifies Trợ lý bác sĩ rows as `doctor-assistant` even when migrated data also has `isdoctor=true`.

Changed URLs / API routes / data flow:
- Frontend: `/services` patient service form and appointment staff fields consume `useEmployees()` roles for `DoctorSelector filterRoles={['doctor-assistant']}`.
- Data flow: `GET /api/Employees` → `useEmployees.mapApiEmployeeToEmployee` → `inferRoleFromFlags` → `DoctorSelector`.

User roles: Clinic staff creating or editing appointments and patient service records.

Happy paths:
- [ ] PENDING: Open a service form on NK2, choose a branch with active Trợ lý bác sĩ rows, and confirm the `Trợ lý Bác sĩ` dropdown lists staff.
- [ ] PENDING: Search the dropdown with unaccented text such as `tro ly` and confirm Vietnamese role/name matches still appear.
- [ ] PENDING: Plain doctors remain visible in the `Bác sĩ` dropdown and plain assistants remain visible in the `Phụ tá` dropdown.

Edge cases / regressions:
- [ ] PENDING: A migrated row with `isdoctor=true`, `isassistant=true`, and `jobtitle='Trợ lý bác sĩ'` maps to role `doctor-assistant`.
- [ ] PENDING: An inactive Trợ lý bác sĩ row stays hidden from the dropdown.
- [ ] PENDING: Employee list role counts include doctor-assistant rows without breaking the employees page.

Setup/login data: Staff login on NK2 with a branch containing active Trợ lý bác sĩ employees.
