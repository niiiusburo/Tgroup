# TestSprite Plan: Payment Method Contract Alignment

Feature/edit name: Payment Method Contract Alignment

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/payment`
- `/customers/:id` payment/deposit surfaces
- `GET /api/Payments`
- `GET /api/Payments/:id`
- `POST /api/Payments`
- `PATCH /api/Payments/:id`
- `POST /api/Payments/:id/proof`
- No new API routes added.

Affected data flows:
- Frontend deposit/payment display labels now align with the live payment contract methods: `cash`, `bank_transfer`, `deposit`, and `mixed`.
- `contracts/dist` is rebuilt from `contracts/payment.ts`, so package consumers no longer see stale card/e-wallet enum values.
- VietQR remains a frontend entry alias that sends `bank_transfer` to the backend; it is not stored as a separate payment method.

User roles:
- Admin or payment staff with `payment.view` and `payment.add`.
- Customer-profile staff using deposit history and payment tabs.

Happy paths:
- Open `/payment` and verify existing cash, bank-transfer, deposit, and mixed payment rows display readable method labels.
- Open a customer profile payment/deposit surface and verify deposit history displays `bank_transfer` as a bank-transfer label, not the raw key.
- Create or edit a payment using cash/bank/deposit/mixed flows and confirm the backend receives only live method codes.

Edge cases:
- Legacy rows with unknown method strings should fall back to the raw method string instead of crashing.
- VietQR top-up flows should still map to `bank_transfer`.
- English and Vietnamese payment labels should both have `bank_transfer` and `deposit` keys.

Regressions:
- Payment history, deposit history, refunds, void/delete actions, payment proof uploads, and report/export payment-method grouping still work.
- No card/e-wallet methods should appear as accepted live payment methods in contracts, docs, or payment UI labels.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin/staff session with payment permissions.
- Use any customer with deposit/payment rows containing cash, bank transfer, deposit usage, or mixed payments.

TestSprite execution items:
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `/payment` renders live payment method labels without card/e-wallet options.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `/customers/:id` deposit history renders `bank_transfer` and `deposit` labels in English and Vietnamese locales.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify VietQR top-up still posts `bank_transfer` to `POST /api/Payments`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `contracts/dist/payment.d.ts` and `contracts/payment.ts` expose the same live method enum.

# TestSprite Plan: Documentation Traceability And Governance Sync

Feature/edit name: Documentation Traceability And Governance Sync

Changed URLs and API routes:
- No user-facing URLs changed.
- No runtime API behavior changed.
- Documentation coverage updated for `/api/Partners/resolve`, `/api/Feedback/unread-count`, `/api/IpAccess/*`, `/api/DotKhams`, `POST /api/Exports/:type/preview`, `POST /api/Exports/:type/download`, `/api/Reports/*`, `GET /api/SaleOrders/lines`, `PATCH /api/SaleOrders/:id`, `DELETE /api/SaleOrderLines/:id`, `PATCH /api/Payments/:id`, and `POST /api/Payments/:id/proof`.

Affected data flows:
- Feature work should now be traceable across use case, workflow, contract, data model, product-map domain, permission registry, and test matrix entries.
- Deployment docs use `api/migrations/` as the canonical migration path and mark `api/src/db/migrations/` as supplemental stragglers needing explicit review.
- `scripts/verify-docs.sh` now enforces docs, changelog, and TestSprite ledger updates for contract/schema/API/frontend/backend-data-flow changes.
- Local `.husky/pre-commit`, root `npm run verify:docs` / `npm run verify:governance`, and PR checks now run the governance gate so future changes cannot rely on optional manual memory.
- Authority docs no longer embed generated memory blocks, and `scripts/sync-claude-mem.sh` strips accidental generated-memory blocks from `AGENTS.md` while keeping the real memory mirror in `.claude/memory.md`.

User roles:
- Architecture and product agents checking feature blast radius before implementation.
- Frontend, backend, data, QA, and release agents using the authority stack.
- TestSprite verification agent reading this ledger after a feature/edit.

Happy paths:
- Pick a report/export feature and confirm the route appears in `docs/CONTRACTS.md`, `product-map/contracts/api-index.md`, `docs/USE-CASES.md`, `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`, and a test matrix entry.
- Run `bash scripts/verify-docs.sh` with the current diff and confirm it passes when docs, changelog, and `testbright.md` are present.
- Check `docs/RUNBOOK.md` and `docs/runbooks/DEPLOYMENT.md`; both should point canonical VPS migration application to `/opt/tgroup/api/migrations/*.sql`.

Edge cases:
- Docs-only governance edits still require `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Frontend, feature, contract, product-map, and backend data-flow edits require `testbright.md`.
- Supplemental migrations under `api/src/db/migrations/` must not be silently assumed to run with the canonical migration loop.
- Authority docs must not contain `<claude-mem-context>` blocks.

Regressions:
- Existing Revenue Report Excel Reconciliation TestSprite plan remains intact.
- Existing production database backup, Hosoonline, Face ID, export, and search TestSprite plans remain intact.
- Runtime behavior, API responses, and website routes should not change from this docs/governance sync alone.

Setup data and login state:
- No login state required for docs/script verification.
- Use repository root `/Users/thuanle/Documents/TamTMV/Tgrouptest`.

TestSprite execution items:
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: `bash scripts/verify-docs.sh` passes through `npm run verify:governance` with this synchronized docs/changelog/testbright diff.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: `.husky/pre-commit` runs `bash scripts/verify-docs.sh` before website version checks.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` includes a `doc-governance` job that runs documentation governance against the PR base SHA.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: `npm run verify:governance` runs the docs gate plus whitespace diff checks.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: Generated-memory marker grep returns no matches outside `docs/runbooks/VERIFICATION.md`.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: `bash scripts/sync-claude-mem.sh` does not leave generated-memory markers in `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `docs/RUNBOOK.md` and `docs/runbooks/DEPLOYMENT.md` both use `/opt/tgroup/api/migrations/*.sql` as the canonical deploy loop.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `docs/DATA-MODEL.md` and `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` document 53 canonical root migrations and 2 supplemental migrations.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify payment methods in docs/contracts are `cash`, `bank_transfer`, `deposit`, and `mixed`, with no unsupported card/e-wallet methods described as live.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify key live routes above are represented in `docs/CONTRACTS.md` and `product-map/contracts/api-index.md`.

# TestSprite Plan: Prompt-Level Authority Gate

Feature/edit name: Prompt-Level Authority Gate

Changed URLs and API routes:
- No user-facing URLs changed.
- No runtime API routes changed.

Affected data flows:
- Each new agent prompt in Claude-compatible local tooling now runs `scripts/prompt-authority-check.sh` through `.claude/settings.json` `UserPromptSubmit`.
- The prompt gate verifies core authority files exist, strips accidental generated-memory blocks from `AGENTS.md`, checks that generated memory markers did not leak into other authority docs, and prints prompt-matched docs/domains for agents to read before edits.
- Root `npm run verify:prompt` provides the manual fallback for agents/tools that do not execute `.claude/settings.json` prompt hooks.
- Root `npm run verify:governance` now includes the prompt authority gate before doc-update and whitespace checks.

User roles:
- Architecture, product, frontend, backend, data, QA, and release agents starting or continuing project work.
- TestSprite verification agent checking that prompt-start governance is visible before implementation.

Happy paths:
- Submit a prompt mentioning payments/revenue and verify the prompt gate points to money-flow, invariants, payment domain, and payment-allocation docs.
- Submit a prompt mentioning frontend UI and verify the prompt gate points to `website/agents.md`, `website/design.md`, behavior/use-case/workflow/test docs, and `testbright.md`.
- Run `npm run verify:prompt` from the repository root and verify it passes without stdin.

Edge cases:
- If authority docs are missing, the prompt gate must fail before work starts.
- If generated memory markers leak into non-`AGENTS.md` authority docs, the prompt gate must fail and print the matching file/line.
- If generated memory markers are appended to `AGENTS.md`, the prompt gate should strip them before checking so the next prompt is not blocked by memory-tool output.
- If the active agent does not support `UserPromptSubmit`, the fallback is manual `npm run verify:prompt` at prompt start.

Regressions:
- Existing commit/PR documentation governance must still run after the prompt gate.
- The hook output must stay compact enough that prompt checking does not become token-heavy.
- Runtime app behavior should not change from this governance hook.

Setup data and login state:
- No app login required.
- Use repository root `/Users/thuanle/Documents/TamTMV/Tgrouptest`.

TestSprite execution items:
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: `npm run verify:prompt` passes with no stdin and prints the compact authority reminder.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: Payment/revenue prompt text surfaces money-flow, invariants, payment domain, payment allocation, reports, and test matrix docs.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: Frontend prompt text surfaces website frontend/design docs, behavior, use-case, workflow, test matrix, and `testbright.md`.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: `.claude/settings.json` contains a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that runs `bash scripts/prompt-authority-check.sh`.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-17: `package.json` `verify:governance` runs the prompt authority gate before docs and whitespace checks.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-18: Prompt gate stripped an accidental `<claude-mem-context>` block from `AGENTS.md`, then `npm run verify:prompt` passed and marker grep returned clean.

# TestSprite Plan: Revenue Report Excel Reconciliation

Feature/edit name: Revenue Report Excel Reconciliation

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/reports/revenue`
- `POST /api/Reports/revenue/summary`
- `POST /api/Reports/revenue/by-location`
- `POST /api/Exports/revenue-flat/preview`
- `POST /api/Exports/revenue-flat/download`
- `POST /api/Exports/report-sales-employees/preview`
- `POST /api/Exports/report-sales-employees/download`

Affected data flows:
- Revenue page `Tổng đã thu` uses posted payment-method totals from `/api/Reports/revenue/summary`, matching the revenue-flat Excel collected total.
- `/api/Reports/revenue/summary` keeps paid-only sale-order states instead of dropping payments whose sale order was created outside the selected report date.
- Employee revenue Excel applies the same posted allocation, deposit/refund/usage exclusion rules as revenue-flat.
- Branch revenue breakdown now honors the selected branch filter; all-location remains all branches.
- Cash-flow cards still show raw cash movement and should not be used as the Excel paid-revenue comparison.

User roles:
- Admin or manager with `reports.view`.
- Staff with `payments.export` for `revenue-flat` export.
- Staff with `reports.export` for employee revenue export.
- Scoped branch manager with assigned-location reporting access.

Happy paths:
- On `/reports/revenue`, select `2026-05-16` to `2026-05-16` and all locations; `Tổng đã thu` should equal `revenue-flat` preview `Tổng tiền` and downloaded workbook column `Số tiền`.
- Select a specific branch; revenue summary, revenue by branch, and revenue-flat preview should all use the same branch scope.
- Preview and download `Báo cáo doanh thu theo nhân viên`; deposits, refunds, deposit usage, and voided payments must not appear in employee revenue totals.

Edge cases:
- Payments collected in the selected date range for sale orders created before the selected date must still count in `Tổng đã thu`.
- A branch/date range with paid revenue but no new sale orders should still show collected revenue.
- `companyId: "all"` from any report caller should behave like no branch filter in frontend report payloads.
- Deposit top-ups and internal deposit usage remain visible only in cash-flow or deposit reports, not recognized paid revenue.

Regressions:
- Existing revenue trend, payment method donut, doctor/category breakdowns, and export preview modal still render.
- `Báo cáo doanh thu` workbook columns and filename stay unchanged.
- Existing cash-flow summary still separates money in, money out, net cash flow, and internal deposit usage.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated NK2 or local admin session with report/export permissions.
- For live reproduction, NK2 evidence used all-location filter `{ "dateFrom": "2026-05-16", "dateTo": "2026-05-16" }`.
- Download workbook and sum column `Số tiền`; do not compare dashboard `Tổng đã thu` to workbook `Tổng tiền phiếu`.

TestSprite execution items:
- [x] PRE-DEPLOY FAIL 2026-05-18: Live NK2 `/reports/revenue` for `2026-05-16` all locations still showed `Tổng đã thu` around `318.537.157 ₫`, while the posted-payment report API total was `533.697.000 ₫`; screenshot proof: `output/playwright/2026-05-18T04-48-03-856Z-feedback-06892fc6-revenue-total-fixed.png`.
- [x] PASS 2026-05-18: After NK2 web-only deploy to `v0.32.24`, `/reports/revenue` for `2026-05-16` all locations shows `Tổng đã thu 533.697.000 ₫`, matching `POST /api/Reports/revenue/summary` posted-payment total; proof screenshots: `output/playwright/2026-05-18T04-55-02-553Z-feedback-06892fc6-revenue-total-resolved-stable.png` and `output/playwright/2026-05-18T04-57-35-499Z-feedback-06892fc6-status-resolved-via-page.png`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `/reports/revenue` `Tổng đã thu` equals `POST /api/Exports/revenue-flat/preview` summary `Tổng tiền` for the same date/branch filters.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify downloaded `Báo cáo doanh thu` workbook column `Số tiền` equals the page `Tổng đã thu`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify paid revenue from old sale orders inside the payment date range is not dropped from `Tổng đã thu`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify selecting a branch scopes summary, branch breakdown, and revenue-flat preview consistently.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify employee revenue export excludes deposit, refund, deposit usage, and voided payment rows.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify cash-flow cards still show raw cash movement separately and are not mislabeled as Excel paid revenue.

# TestSprite Plan: TGClinic Orange Butterfly Favicon

Feature/edit name: TGClinic Orange Butterfly Favicon

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/`
- All website routes that inherit `website/index.html`
- Static asset: `/favicon.svg`
- No API routes changed.

Affected data flows:
- Browser loads the SVG favicon from `website/public/favicon.svg`.
- Vite serves the icon through the app shell defined in `website/index.html`.
- No backend, database, auth, or user-record data flow changed.

User roles:
- Any authenticated or unauthenticated browser visitor.
- Admin, receptionist, dentist, and manager roles should see the same browser-tab icon.

Happy paths:
- Open the local website and confirm the browser tab loads the orange butterfly favicon.
- Fetch `/favicon.svg` and confirm it returns SVG content.
- Navigate between routes and confirm the favicon remains stable because the app shell owns it.

Edge cases:
- Browser cache may keep the old Vite icon until hard refresh or cache clear.
- SVG favicon should remain legible at 16x16 and 32x32 browser-tab sizes.
- Missing favicon should not block app startup or route rendering.

Regressions:
- `website/index.html` still loads `/src/main.tsx`.
- Existing page title and version bootstrap script remain unchanged.
- No API route or permission behavior changes.

Setup data and login state:
- No special data or login state required.
- Use the normal local website dev server.

TestSprite execution items:
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `GET /favicon.svg` returns the orange butterfly SVG asset.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify the browser tab icon changes from the default Vite icon to the orange butterfly on `/`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify a nested app route keeps the same favicon after navigation.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify the app shell still mounts and renders the React app.

# TestSprite Plan: NK Production Database Daily Backup Rotation

Feature/edit name: NK Production Database Daily Backup Rotation

Changed URLs and API routes:
- No user-facing URLs changed.
- No API routes changed.
- VPS target: `https://nk.2checkin.com`
- VPS script: `/opt/tgroup/scripts/backup-nk-db.sh`
- Backup directory: `/opt/tgroup/backups/nk-db-daily/`

Affected data flows:
- `pg_dump` reads the production `tdental_demo` database from Docker container `tgroup-db`.
- The backup job writes compressed PostgreSQL custom-format dump files and `.sha256` checksums.
- Retention keeps only the latest 3 `nk-tdental_demo-*.dump` files after a successful new backup.

User roles:
- Infra/Release operator with root SSH access to the VPS.
- Clinic users should see no product behavior change.

Happy paths:
- Manual run of `/opt/tgroup/scripts/backup-nk-db.sh` creates a non-empty dump and checksum.
- `sha256sum -c` passes for the newest dump.
- `pg_restore -l` can list the dump table of contents through `tgroup-db`.
- Root crontab contains one daily entry scheduled for 12:00 Vietnam time.

Edge cases:
- If `tgroup-db` is missing or unhealthy, the script exits before writing a successful backup.
- If `pg_dump` creates an empty temp file, the temp file is removed and no retention cleanup runs.
- Retention cleanup should only remove older matching NK dump/checksum pairs after a successful backup.
- The VPS currently uses UTC, so the cron expression is `0 5 * * *`.

Regressions:
- Existing `tgroup-api`, `tgroup-web`, and `tgroup-db` containers must remain running.
- Existing `/opt/tgroup/backups/db-sync/` backups must not be touched.
- No database restore, sync, import, export to local, or schema migration should run as part of this job.

Setup data and login state:
- Use SSH alias `dokploy` or `root@76.13.16.68`.
- Use app path `/opt/tgroup`, container `tgroup-db`, database `tdental_demo`.

TestSprite execution items:
- [ ] PENDING: Verify the newest backup file exists in `/opt/tgroup/backups/nk-db-daily/` and is non-empty.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify the newest `.sha256` file passes `sha256sum -c`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `docker exec -i tgroup-db pg_restore -l < newest.dump` lists `tdental_demo` archive contents.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `crontab -l` contains exactly one `backup-nk-db.sh` entry scheduled for `0 5 * * *`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify the retained matching `.dump` count is not greater than 3 after future daily runs.

# TestSprite Plan: NK Hosoonline Session-Token Image Hotfix

Feature/edit name: NK Hosoonline Session-Token Image Hotfix

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/customers/61d6759f-f2e2-4443-8d5b-b3a7003ab7c5`
- `/customers/:id`
- `GET /api/ExternalCheckups/:customerCode`
- `GET /api/ExternalCheckups/images/:imageName`
- `POST /api/ExternalCheckups/:customerCode/health-checkups`

Affected data flows:
- Hosoonline checkup list still loads through `GET /api/ExternalCheckups/:customerCode`.
- Proxied Hosoonline image and upload fetches now send the TGClinic bearer token from either local storage or session storage.
- Non-remembered NK login sessions should no longer get `401 {"error":"No token"}` for checkup thumbnails.

User roles:
- Authenticated admin or clinic staff with `external_checkups.view`.
- Staff with `external_checkups.upload` for upload regression coverage.

Happy paths:
- Log into NK without Remember Me, open `/customers/61d6759f-f2e2-4443-8d5b-b3a7003ab7c5`, and verify Health Checkup Images thumbnails render.
- Verify `GET /api/ExternalCheckups/images/:imageName` requests include `Authorization: Bearer ...` and return image bytes.
- With upload permission, verify add-checkup upload still sends auth to `POST /api/ExternalCheckups/:customerCode/health-checkups`.

Edge cases:
- Remember Me sessions that store the token in local storage should continue to render images.
- Missing or expired sessions should still receive 401 and trigger the existing failed-image state.
- Hosoonline `http://` media URLs should still be normalized through the existing HTTPS/proxy path.

Regressions:
- Customer profile loading, profile tabs, and the checkup list must still render.
- Existing `external_checkups.view` permission gate must continue to protect image bytes.
- Existing upload form behavior and error parsing must remain unchanged.

Setup data and login state:
- Use NK production login state.
- Use customer `T056733` from `/customers/61d6759f-f2e2-4443-8d5b-b3a7003ab7c5`, which currently has Hosoonline image records.

TestSprite execution items:
- [ ] PENDING: Verify non-remembered NK session renders Hosoonline thumbnails on `/customers/61d6759f-f2e2-4443-8d5b-b3a7003ab7c5`.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify image requests include Authorization and return `image/*`, not 401 JSON.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify remembered/local-storage sessions still render Hosoonline thumbnails.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify the upload form still sends Authorization when staff has `external_checkups.upload`.

# TestSprite Plan: Reporting And Permission Feedback Completion

Feature/edit name: Revenue Recognition Reports, Cash Flow Report, Payment Permission Split, and Ho so Online Upload Gate

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/reports/revenue`
- `/reports/services`
- `/customers/:id`
- `/permissions`
- `POST /api/Reports/revenue/summary`
- `POST /api/Reports/revenue/trend`
- `POST /api/Reports/revenue/by-location`
- `POST /api/Reports/revenue/by-doctor`
- `POST /api/Reports/revenue/by-category`
- `POST /api/Reports/services/breakdown`
- `POST /api/Reports/cash-flow/summary`
- `POST /api/Payments`
- `POST /api/Payments/refund`
- `DELETE /api/Payments/:id`
- `POST /api/Payments/:id/void`
- `GET /api/ExternalCheckups/:customerCode`
- `POST /api/ExternalCheckups/:customerCode/patient`
- `POST /api/ExternalCheckups/:customerCode/health-checkups`

Affected data flows:
- Revenue report paid totals now come from posted `payment_allocations` linked to treatment invoices instead of unpaid sale-order totals or deposits.
- Deposits, refunds, deposit usage, and voided payments stay in cash-flow reporting and are excluded from revenue recognition.
- Cash-flow summary is mounted through `/api/Reports/cash-flow/summary`.
- Service/category/source report revenue uses posted payment allocations instead of listed service prices or unpaid order values.
- Payment creation, refunds, and destructive void/delete actions use separate permission strings: `payment.add`, `payment.refund`, and `payment.void`.
- Ho so Online view, patient creation, and image upload are split into `external_checkups.view`, `external_checkups.create`, and `external_checkups.upload`; the customer profile hides create/upload controls for view-only staff.

User roles:
- Super Admin/Admin with full reporting and permission access.
- Receptionist or clinic staff with payment add/view but without destructive payment void permission.
- Dentist or other view-only clinic role with `external_checkups.view` but no upload permission.
- Dental Assistant/Assistant role with assigned-location customer access and `external_checkups.upload`.
- Reporting staff with `reports.view`.

TestSprite execution items:
- [ ] PENDING: On `/reports/revenue`, verify summary paid totals match posted treatment payment allocations and do not count customer deposits.
- [ ] PENDING: On `/reports/revenue`, verify trend, location, doctor, and category breakdowns show paid service revenue by payment date.
- [ ] PENDING: On `/reports/services`, verify source/category revenue excludes unpaid listed treatment value and deposits.
- [ ] PENDING: Call `POST /api/Reports/cash-flow/summary` and verify deposits, refunds, deposit usage, voided payments, money in/out, and net cash-flow are separated.
- [ ] PENDING: With a user lacking `payment.void`, verify payment delete/void actions fail with 403 or are hidden where the UI has permission context.
- [ ] PENDING: With a user lacking `external_checkups.upload`, open `/customers/:id` and verify Ho so Online images can be viewed but the add-checkup upload button is hidden.
- [ ] PENDING: With a user that has `external_checkups.upload`, verify the add-checkup upload button appears and upload submits to `POST /api/ExternalCheckups/:customerCode/health-checkups`.
- [ ] PENDING: With a Dental Assistant/Assistant role, verify customer search/profile/Hồ sơ online upload works, while treatment, deposit, and payment creation remain blocked.
- [ ] PENDING: Open `/permissions` and verify `payment.void` and `external_checkups.upload` are visible permission options with descriptions.

Edge cases:
- Partial payments split across multiple sale-order lines.
- Overallocated imported payment allocation rows should not exceed the posted payment amount in service/person export-style calculations.
- Deposit usage with `method = deposit` should not increase revenue.
- Voided payments should stay out of recognized revenue and appear only as cash-flow adjustments.
- Ho so Online patient missing state should not show create/upload controls unless the user has the matching permission.

Regressions:
- Existing `/reports/revenue` chart/table shapes remain compatible with the frontend.
- Payment history, deposit list, and customer profile payment tabs still load for `payment.view` users.
- Existing Hosoonline image proxy remains protected by `external_checkups.view`.
- Existing permission-board role editing still saves unknown/new permission strings.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session for full checks.
- Use at least one scoped clinic role without `payment.void` and without `external_checkups.upload`.
- Use customers with existing payments, deposits, and Ho so Online images.

# TestSprite Plan: Overview Wait Timer Arrival Timestamp Repair

Feature/edit name: Overview Wait Timer Arrival Timestamp Repair

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/`
- `PUT /api/Appointments/:id`

Affected data flows:
- Marking an appointment `arrived` writes `datetimearrived` as Vietnam wall-clock time instead of a DB-session-dependent double timezone conversion.
- Overview `PatientCheckInCard` keeps the full `datetimearrived` timestamp through `useOverviewAppointments` and `WaitTimer` instead of comparing only time-of-day.
- In-treatment and done transitions continue stamping `datetimeseated` and `datedone` from the same Vietnam timestamp source.

User roles:
- Admin and clinic staff with `appointments.edit` and `overview.view`.

Happy paths:
- Mark a scheduled appointment as arrived from `/`, wait 3-5 seconds, and confirm the card timer counts upward instead of staying at `0s`.
- Refresh `/` after marking arrived and confirm the timer uses the persisted `datetimearrived` timestamp.
- Move the same appointment to `Đang khám` and confirm the waiting timer becomes static using the treatment start time.

Edge cases:
- Existing arrived rows with bad historical timestamps should not block new check-ins from getting correct timestamps after this fix.
- Local DB sessions with a non-Vietnam `current_setting('TimeZone')` should still stamp Vietnam wall-clock appointment timestamps.
- Persisted timestamps whose date differs from today should not clamp to `0s` only because their clock time is later than the current clock time.
- Check-in timers should not regress to whole-minute-only display after the first minute.

Regressions:
- Appointment creation still populates `datecreated` and `lastupdated`.
- Staff clear/save behavior on `PUT /api/Appointments/:id` remains intact.
- Calendar appointment listing and overview today-only filtering remain unchanged.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session.
- Use any today appointment that is still scheduled or confirmed.
- For backend verification, assert the update SQL contains `NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh'` and does not contain the double `UTC` timezone conversion.

---

# TestSprite Plan: Customer Appointment Start Time

Feature/edit name: Customer Appointment Start Time

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/customers/:id`
- `GET /api/Appointments?partner_id=...`

Affected data flows:
- Customer profile appointment history now preserves a start time from `dbo.appointments.date` when the legacy `time` column is null.
- The profile hook still normalizes appointment dates to the selected timezone for date badges.
- Duration continues to use `timeexpected`.

User roles:
- Authenticated admin or clinic staff with customer profile access.

Happy paths:
- Open `/customers/9a358608-c0c2-47e5-88c0-b361006ddb39`.
- Go to `Lịch sử lịch hẹn`.
- Rows such as `AP244803` with `time = null` and timestamped `date` should show the local start time instead of `--:--`.
- Rows with explicit `time`, such as `09:00`, should keep that explicit time.

Edge cases:
- Plain `YYYY-MM-DD` dates without a time component should still show `--:--` if `time` is null.
- ISO timestamps should display in the selected app timezone, defaulting to `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`.

Regressions:
- Date badges must not shift one day.
- Customer profile appointment counts, doctor/team display, status badges, and edit buttons should continue to render.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session.
- Use the current production customer URL `/customers/9a358608-c0c2-47e5-88c0-b361006ddb39` or another customer with migrated appointments where `time` is null and `date` contains a timestamp.

# TestSprite Plan: Appointment Export Time Preservation

Feature/edit name: Appointment Export Time Preservation

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/calendar`
- `/appointments`
- `/reports/appointments`
- `POST /api/Exports/:type/preview`
- `POST /api/Exports/:type/download`

Affected data flows:
- Appointment operational Excel exports now preserve the full appointment timestamp from `dbo.appointments.date` when the legacy `time` column is empty.
- Export filename and workbook date formatting should continue to use Vietnam time.
- The API runtime should run with `TZ=Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` so PostgreSQL timestamp parsing matches the clinic UI.

User roles:
- Authenticated admin or clinic staff with export access for calendar, appointments, or reports surfaces.

Happy paths:
- Export appointments where `date` contains a full timestamp and `time` is null; the exported workbook should show the stored appointment hour, not `00:00`.
- Export appointments where both `date` and `time` are present; the explicit legacy time should still win.
- Preview and download should return the same row count for the same filters.

Edge cases:
- Null appointment date returns a blank export date instead of crashing.
- ISO string dates and plain `YYYY-MM-DD` strings still produce valid workbook dates.
- Large date-range downloads should complete behind the production `/api` proxy timeout.

Regressions:
- Existing export types must still register and download.
- Appointment calendar display should not shift by one day or lose appointment hours.
- Export audit behavior should continue to record preview/download attempts.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session, preferably `website/.auth/admin.json` if valid.
- Use appointments with `dbo.appointments.date` values containing afternoon times and null `time` values.

# TestSprite Plan: Accent-Insensitive Search

Feature/edit name: Accent-Insensitive Search

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/`
- `/calendar`
- `/appointments`
- `/customers`
- `/employees`
- `/services`
- `/service-catalog`
- `/payment`
- `/permissions`
- `/api/Appointments?search=...`
- `/api/Partners?search=...`
- `/api/Employees?search=...`
- `/api/Products?search=...`
- `/api/ProductCategories?search=...`
- `/api/SaleOrders?search=...`
- Other API list searches that accept `search`, including cash books, receipts, CRM tasks, monthly plans, stock pickings, journals, payslips, commissions, and website pages.

Affected data flows:
- Overview staff search within `Lịch trình ngày` and `Lịch hẹn hôm nay` normalizes both the query and appointment text before matching.
- Overview `Today's Services / Activity` search is currently a placeholder with no service rows to filter; when service rows are added, the same accent-insensitive rule applies.
- Staff type unaccented Vietnamese search terms into frontend search inputs.
- Frontend-only list filters normalize both the query and displayed row text.
- API-backed searches send the raw query; backend SQL compares both raw and accent-stripped forms.
- Customer code, phone, appointment number, sale order number, and receipt/reference searches must still work.

User roles:
- Admin user with access to customers, calendar, appointments, employees, services, payment, settings/permissions, and reporting-style operational lists.
- Scoped clinic staff should see only data allowed by existing route permissions and location filters.

Happy paths:
- On `/`, searching `nguyen`, `thoai`, or `duong` in the Overview appointment searches finds matching accented customer, doctor, assistant, TLBS, location, or note text when matching rows exist.
- On `/`, typing into the `Lịch trình ngày` search must not change the `Lịch hẹn hôm nay` search, and typing into `Lịch hẹn hôm nay` must not change `Lịch trình ngày`.
- Searching `quyen` finds records containing `Quyền`.
- Searching `nguyen` finds records containing `Nguyễn`.
- Searching `my han` finds records containing `Mỹ Hân`.
- Existing accented searches such as `quyền` still find the same records.
- Numeric and alphanumeric searches such as phone numbers, `T8250`, `AP...`, and `SO...` still return the expected records.

Edge cases:
- Mixed case search terms.
- Extra leading/trailing spaces.
- Empty search term should return the normal unfiltered list.
- Vietnamese `đ`/`Đ` should match `d`.
- Search counts and pagination totals should match the visible filtered rows.

Regressions:
- Customer search must not fall back to phone-digit matching for alphanumeric customer codes.
- Calendar day search, Today Appointments search, payment search, service catalog category search, and permission-board employee search should not require accents.
- Backend count/aggregate queries must not fail when search uses joined display fields.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session, preferably `website/.auth/admin.json` if it is still valid.
- Seed or pick records containing accented Vietnamese names such as `Phạm Thị Thảo Quyền`, `Nguyễn Thị Mỹ Hân`, and a customer code like `T8250`.

# TestSprite Plan: Guided Face Profile Capture

Feature/edit name: Guided Face Profile Capture

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/customers`
- `/customers/:id`
- `POST /api/face/register`
- `GET /api/face/status/:partnerId`

Affected data flows:
- Add-customer face capture now guides staff through straight, left, and right customer head positions.
- New customers with a saved no-match face scan register all captured profile samples after the customer record is created.
- Existing customer face registration stores multiple profile samples through the existing face-register endpoint.
- Face status sample count should increase by the number of accepted profile samples.

User roles:
- Admin or clinic staff with `customers.view` and `customers.edit`.

Happy paths:
- Opening the customer add form and using face scan shows the three-step guide: straight, left, right.
- A no-match customer add stores the pending profile samples and registers them after Save.
- Editing an existing customer and pressing Register Face stores three samples without leaving the modal stuck in processing.

Edge cases:
- Camera denied shows the existing permission error.
- Staff can still switch camera before scanning.
- Manual Capture during a profile step advances to the next pose.
- Closing the modal clears pending profile samples.

Regressions:
- Quick Face ID recognition still opens from the header and can recognize or cancel.
- Existing single-image face recognition APIs remain compatible with `FaceCaptureModal` callers.
- Failed post-save face registration must not block the created customer record.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session with camera permission enabled.
- Use fake camera media for browser automation, or a real local camera for manual verification.
- Use a test customer that can be safely edited for `/customers/:id` face registration checks.

---

# TestSprite Plan: CompreFace Face ID Provider

Feature/edit name: CompreFace Face ID Provider

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/customers`
- `/customers/:id`
- Header Quick Face ID button on all authenticated routes
- `POST /api/face/recognize`
- `POST /api/face/register`
- `POST /api/face/re-register`
- `GET /api/face/status/:partnerId`
- `GET /api/health`

Affected data flows:
- Browser camera still captures the JPEG through `FaceCaptureModal`.
- Backend Face ID provider is selected by `FACE_RECOGNITION_PROVIDER=local|compreface`.
- CompreFace mode registers subjects with `partners.id`, uploads face examples to CompreFace, maps recognition subjects back to `dbo.partners`, and updates `partners.face_subject_id` / `face_registered_at`.
- Local mode continues to use `face-service` embeddings in `dbo.customer_face_embeddings`.

User roles:
- Admin or clinic staff with `customers.view` for recognition.
- Admin or clinic staff with `customers.edit` for registration/re-registration.

Happy paths:
- With `FACE_RECOGNITION_PROVIDER=compreface`, `/api/health` reports `faceProvider: "compreface"` and `checks.faceService: true` when CompreFace is reachable with a valid key.
- Registering a customer face creates or reuses a CompreFace subject and returns `{ success, partnerId, sampleId, sampleCount, faceRegisteredAt }`.
- Re-registering from `/customers/:id` replaces the CompreFace subject examples and returns all sample IDs.
- Quick Face ID recognition maps a CompreFace subject back to the correct customer and opens `/customers/:id`.

Edge cases:
- Missing or invalid `COMPREFACE_API_KEY` degrades Face ID health without blocking unrelated customer pages.
- Existing CompreFace subject returns 409 and registration still adds a new example.
- Deleted/missing CompreFace subject during re-register is ignored before recreating it.
- Unknown CompreFace subjects are ignored instead of linking to the wrong customer.
- Low-confidence results return candidates or no-match, not an automatic customer jump.
- Browser sessions without native `FaceDetector` support must not auto-capture a center face from frame quality alone.
- CompreFace recognize/register requests must send a native multipart `file` part; provider responses like "Required part file is missing" indicate the upload client is broken.
- `NO_FACE` from local or CompreFace providers must keep the camera modal open and show "Không phát hiện khuôn mặt" / "Face not detected".
- CompreFace no-face responses must return HTTP 422 with `error: "NO_FACE"`, not a generic engine error.

Regressions:
- `FACE_RECOGNITION_PROVIDER=local` still uses `face-service` and `dbo.customer_face_embeddings`.
- Single-image capture callers still work with `POST /api/face/register`.
- Guided profile capture still sends three images for re-registration.
- Manual customer search fallback still works after no-match.
- Header Quick Face ID, customer camera widget, and profile re-registration all keep capture open on no-face failures until staff manually closes it.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session with camera permission enabled.
- Use fake camera media for automation or a real local camera for manual checks.
- Start CompreFace with `docker compose up -d compreface-postgres-db compreface-api compreface-core`.
- Set a valid `COMPREFACE_API_KEY` for the recognition service and set `FACE_RECOGNITION_PROVIDER=compreface`.
- Use a safe test customer whose Face ID can be replaced.

Execution checklist for the no-face fix:
- [ ] PENDING: With the camera pointed away or covered, verify the capture modal shows "Không phát hiện khuôn mặt" and remains open until cancel/close.
- [ ] PENDING: Trigger CompreFace no-face on `POST /api/face/re-register` and verify HTTP 422 `NO_FACE`, not `ENGINE_ERROR`.
- [ ] PENDING: Trigger Header Quick Face ID no-face and verify it keeps capture open without opening the no-match rescue popover.
- [ ] PENDING: Trigger customer profile re-registration no-face and verify no success toast appears until a valid face is captured.

# TestSprite Plan: Customer Service Quantity Save

Feature/edit name: Customer Service Quantity Save

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/customers/:id`
- `/api/SaleOrders/:id`
- `/api/SaleOrders/lines?partner_id=...`

Affected data flows:
- Staff opens a customer profile and goes to `Phiếu khám`.
- Staff edits an existing service line quantity/unit such as `1 răng`.
- The edit form saves through the parent sale order route.
- The backend must update both `saleorders.quantity` and the rendered `saleorderlines.productuomqty`.
- The customer profile reloads sale-order lines and shows the saved quantity without a manual page reload.

User roles:
- Admin or clinic staff with `customers.edit` and service-record access.

Happy paths:
- Open a customer with at least one service line showing `1 răng`.
- Edit that service and change quantity to another value, for example `3`.
- Save the form.
- Reopen the same customer `Phiếu khám` row and confirm the quantity column shows `3 răng`.
- Reopen the edit modal and confirm the quantity field still shows the saved value.

Edge cases:
- Existing migrated rows where the line quantity differs from the parent order quantity.
- Quantity-only edits with the same price, doctor, service, and tooth values.
- Edits that also change service price, doctor, assistant, TLBS, tooth notes, or unit.

Regressions:
- Payment totals and remaining balance must not duplicate across multi-line orders.
- Delete service still targets the sale-order line id.
- Payment still targets the parent sale order id.
- Existing tooth label such as `manual` remains visible unless staff intentionally changes it.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session.
- Prefer the current customer URL `/customers/f72f8c86-34e9-4377-b59c-b414002ec20c` if seeded locally.
- Use disposable or already-known QA service data when changing quantity.

## Fix Implemented (2026-05-07)

**Root cause:** `ServiceForm.tsx` stored `quantity` as a string, which caused React controlled-input reconciliation issues with `type="number"` — the browser's native number parsing conflicted with React's string value, making the input appear frozen/uneditable.

**Changes:**
- `website/src/components/services/ServiceForm.tsx`:
  - Changed `quantity` state from `string` to `number` (`initialData?.quantity ?? 1`)
  - Fixed `onChange` to parse to number: `setQuantity(v === '' ? 1 : Number(v))`
  - Simplified submit: `quantity || 1` (no more `Number()` coercion needed)
- `website/src/hooks/useServices/mapSaleOrderToServiceRecord.ts`:
  - Fixed `parseFloat("0")` being falsy: changed `order.quantity ? parseFloat(...) : 1` → `order.quantity != null ? parseFloat(...) : 1`

# TestSprite Plan: Customer Initial Load Performance

Feature/edit name: Customer Initial Load Performance

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/customers`
- `/customers/:id`
- `/api/Appointments?offset=0&limit=200`
- `/api/Employees?offset=0&limit=500&active=all`
- `/api/SaleOrders?offset=0&limit=500`

Affected data flows:
- Customer list initial render after login.
- Customer profile hooks that share appointment, employee, and service data.
- Empty-search state for appointments, employees, and services.

User roles:
- Authenticated admin or clinic staff with customer access.

Happy paths:
- Open `/customers` after login and confirm the customer table renders.
- Initial customer-list load should not request profile-only appointments, employees, or sale orders.
- Opening `/customers/:id` should still request profile-specific employees and service data.
- Searching appointments, employees, or services still triggers the debounced search request after typing.

Edge cases:
- Clearing a non-empty search term should reload the unfiltered data once.
- Switching selected customer profile should still load profile-specific services.
- Location-scoped views should still pass the selected location filter.

Regressions:
- Creating or updating appointments and services should still update local state.
- Employee filters and service filters should still work after the initial fetch.
- Version display and guided face capture should continue to load.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session.
- Capture browser network requests for `/customers` and compare duplicate initial API calls before and after the change.

# TestSprite Plan: Staff Selector Clear Option

Feature/edit name: Staff Selector Clear Option

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/appointments`
- `/calendar`
- `/services`
- `/customers/:id` through the service edit modal
- No API route shape changed; existing appointment and sale-order save routes should receive `null`/empty staff values when staff is cleared.

Affected data flows:
- Appointment edit/add form doctor, assistant, and dental-aide selectors.
- Service edit/add form doctor, assistant, and dental-aide selectors.
- Shared `DoctorSelector` clear action now emits `null` instead of an empty string.

User roles:
- Admin or clinic staff allowed to add/edit appointments and patient service records.

Happy paths:
- Open an appointment or service with a selected doctor, assistant, or TLBS.
- Open the staff dropdown and click `Không chọn (None)`.
- Save and reopen the record; the cleared field should stay empty.
- Select another staff member after clearing and save successfully.

Edge cases:
- Clear only one staff role while leaving the other two selected.
- Clear all three staff selectors and save.
- Use search inside the dropdown, then clear the current selection.

Regressions:
- Staff search remains accent-insensitive.
- Staff dropdown still filters by the correct role: doctor, assistant, and doctor-assistant.
- Calendar/service edit saves still close normally and refresh visible records after success.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session.
- Use any appointment or service record that already has doctor, assistant, or TLBS selected.

Fix implemented:
- The shared staff selector now shows the `Không chọn (None)` clear row whenever clearing is enabled, even if the current record has a stale selected id that does not resolve in the active staff list.

# TestSprite Plan: Customer Payment Identity Reconciliation

Feature/edit name: Customer Payment Identity Reconciliation

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/payment`
- `/customers/:id`
- `GET /api/Payments`
- `GET /api/Payments?customerId=...&type=payments`
- `GET /api/Payments/deposits`
- `GET /api/Payments/deposit-usage`
- `GET /api/Payments/:id`

Affected data flows:
- Canonical payment rows now include the linked customer name, phone, and location name from `dbo.partners` / `dbo.companies`.
- `/payment` history maps canonical `dbo.payments` rows into visible customer payment rows without losing customer identity.
- Payment search can match customer names and phones on canonical payment rows, including accent-insensitive searches like `ma van thanh`.
- Customer profile payment tabs and service history still use the same payment and allocation IDs.

User roles:
- Admin or clinic staff with `payment.view`.
- Staff with customer profile access when checking `/customers/:id` payment history.

Happy paths:
- Open `/payment`, search `ma van thanh`, and confirm payments for `MÃ VĂN THÀNH - UP` remain visible.
- Search `0985227087` and confirm both duplicate customer profiles can be reconciled from visible payment identity.
- Open `T050559` customer profile and confirm orthodontic payments total `14.801.000 ₫` against `SO45244`.
- Open `T058004` customer profile and confirm the two `700.000 ₫` payments remain separate on the QL profile.

Edge cases:
- Payment rows with missing partner records should still render without crashing.
- Legacy `accountpayments` fallback rows should include customer identity when fallback is used.
- Voided payments should keep existing status behavior.
- Deposit and deposit-usage endpoints should still return the same rows and counts.

Regressions:
- `/payment` all-location history should not lose receipt/reference code display.
- Outstanding balance cards should still derive from sale orders and not double-count canonical payment rows.
- Customer profile service residual display should still use sale order residual and allocation data.
- Existing accent-insensitive search behavior across payment text fields should remain intact.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session with `payment.view`.
- Use local customer records `T050559` (`MÃ VĂN THÀNH - UP`) and `T058004` (`MÃ VĂN THÀNH - QL`), both phone `0985227087`.
- Use local sale order `SO45244` and payment references `CUST.IN/2026/103918`, `CUST.IN/2026/103919`, and `CUST.IN/2026/102219` as verification anchors.

# TestSprite Plan: Customer Service Paid Total Reconciliation

Feature/edit name: Customer Service Paid Total Reconciliation

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/customers/:id`
- `GET /api/SaleOrders/lines`

Affected data flows:
- Customer service rows derive the paid total from posted payment amounts when imported payment allocation rows overstate the receipt amount.
- Expanded service payment history remains tied to canonical `dbo.payments` rows and should match the service row total.
- Residual display recalculates from the corrected paid amount and imported sale-order total.

User roles:
- Admin or clinic staff with `services.view`.
- Staff reviewing customer service history and payment history on a customer profile.

Happy paths:
- Open customer `T050557` / sale order `SO45243` and expand the payment history.
- Confirm the 8 history rows add to `15.400.000 ₫`.
- Confirm the collapsed service row shows paid `15.400.000 ₫` and residual `4.400.000 ₫` for total `19.800.000 ₫`.
- Confirm direct posted service payments without allocation rows still count in service paid totals.

Edge cases:
- Imported allocation rows where one payment is duplicated above its real posted amount.
- Payments split across more than one invoice should be proportionally capped only when the total allocation exceeds the real payment.
- Voided or non-payment category records should not increase the service paid total.

Regressions:
- Customer service rows with no overallocated imports should keep the same paid and residual totals.
- Service history sorting and product/doctor/dental-aide fields should remain unchanged.
- Payment button and expanded payment-history drawer should still render for partially paid services.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin session with `services.view`.
- Use local customer `T050557` and sale order `SO45243`.
- Verification anchor receipts: `CUST.IN/2025/80040`, `CUST.IN/2025/80041`, `CUST.IN/2025/84122`, `CUST.IN/2025/88698`, `CUST.IN/2025/92961`, `CUST.IN/2026/99621`, `CUST.IN/2026/102814`, `CUST.IN/2026/106326`.

# TestSprite Plan: Employee Sales Export Payment Reconciliation

Feature/edit name: Employee Sales Export Payment Reconciliation

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `/reports`
- Operational export preview/download route for the employee sales report builder.

Affected data flows:
- Employee sales report/export rows normalize overallocated imported `payment_allocations` rows before splitting payment amount across service lines.
- Report totals should match actual posted payment amounts instead of duplicated imported allocation amounts.

User roles:
- Admin or reporting staff with report/export permission.

Happy paths:
- Preview and export employee sales revenue for a date range that includes a fully paid imported service.
- Confirm the report total does not exceed the underlying posted payment amount when allocation rows are duplicated.
- Confirm line-level splitting still works for services with multiple active sale-order lines.

Edge cases:
- Payment allocations whose total exceeds the posted payment amount.
- Multi-line service orders where a normalized allocation needs to be split by line price.
- Location-scoped report users should keep the same permission behavior.

Regressions:
- Normal report filters for date, company, employee type, and employee ID still apply.
- Export workbook grouping and summary totals remain unchanged for non-overallocated data.

Setup data and login state:
- Use an authenticated admin/reporting session.
- Use a date range containing known overallocated imported sale orders such as `SO45243` or high-delta examples from the audit query.

# TestSprite Plan: NK2 Feedback Bug Triage

Feature/edit name: NK2 Feedback Bug Triage

Changed URLs and API routes:
- `https://nk2.2checkin.com/feedback`
- `GET /api/Feedback/all`
- `GET /api/Feedback/all/:threadId`

Affected data flows:
- Feedback admin page lists pending staff-submitted bug reports from `feedback_threads`.
- Feedback verification API returns manual staff reports plus auto-detected API/frontend error threads.
- Report artifacts are written under `reports/feedback-extract/`.

User roles:
- Admin with feedback moderation access.
- QA/TestSprite reviewer reading pending bug reports and auto-error clusters.

Happy paths:
- Log into NK2 as an admin and open `/feedback`.
- Confirm the page lists all pending manual staff reports.
- Fetch `GET /api/Feedback/all` with the same admin session and confirm the manual count matches the visible table.
- Confirm the generated report separates manual staff bugs from auto-detected 401/403 noise, backend 500 clusters, and frontend errors.

Edge cases:
- Expired or missing admin token should redirect to `/login` and not expose feedback data.
- Auto-detected 401/403 threads should be treated as auth/session noise unless tied to a confirmed workflow.
- Backend 500 clusters should preserve endpoint, status, latest timestamp, and occurrence count.
- Manual reports from NK and NK2 URLs should keep the original page URL for reproduction.

Regressions:
- `/feedback` table filtering, status labels, and `View` actions should still work.
- Login should still return to the authorized admin surface after authentication.
- Release notes toast should not block access to the feedback table.

Setup data and login state:
- Use NK2 admin login from `.agents/live-site.env`.
- Latest audit report: `reports/feedback-extract/2026-05-16T12-21-43-239Z-feedback-verification.md`.

TestSprite execution items:
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `/feedback` shows the 8 pending manual staff reports.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify `GET /api/Feedback/all` returns 345 pending feedback threads on NK2.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify manual staff reports are prioritized above auto-error clusters.
- [ ] PENDING: Verify auth/permission noise is not mixed into the manual bug list.

## Face Lab auto-capture reliability (2026-05-18)
- URL: `/face`
- API: `POST /api/face/recognize`
- Verify all 4 modules complete auto-capture within ~15s on browsers without native FaceDetector (Safari, Firefox, Chrome with flag off).
- Verify forced-capture safety net fires at 15s using best frame seen.
- Verify adaptive threshold relaxes after 6s and 10s of scanning.
- Verify "Capture now" button immediately triggers capture using best frame.

## Face Lab inline registration (2026-05-18)
- URL: `/face`
- API: `POST /api/face/register` (multipart partnerId + image)
- Verify: activate Burst module, capture face, no_match result shows "Register this face to a customer" button
- Verify: clicking opens search panel; typing 2+ chars calls `GET /api/Partners?search=...`
- Verify: clicking a customer registers the captured blob; success badge shows partner name
- Re-running the lab against same face should now return a match

## Face Lab recognize-failed recovery (2026-05-18)
- URL: `/face` (iPhone Safari especially)
- Verify: if `POST /api/face/recognize` times out or fails, the lab still shows the captured frame and the Register-face panel
- Verify: camera stops as soon as capture completes (LED off before upload)
- Verify: Register-face still works against captured blob after a recognize failure
